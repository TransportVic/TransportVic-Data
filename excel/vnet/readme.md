# VNet Codes

## About V/Net
The files here are V/Net Booking Codes, used by V/Line Booking Agents (AKA V/Agents) to book V/Line tickets, using the V/Net booking system. V/Net is also used to book [seniors free travel vouchers](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki/concessions-and-free-travel/free-travel-vouchers/free-travel-vouchers-registration-form/) for either metro or regional travel.

V/Net codes are visible to passengers on their V/Line tickets. (Only on e-tickets are the short codes displayed. On paper tickets, the stop name as defined in V/Net is displayed.)

## Files in this directory
### `VNet Bookable Codes.csv` and `VNet Overrides.csv`
The file `VNet Bookable Codes.csv` contains all V/Net Codes as defined in V/Net, including codes that aren't used to represent physical locations (train stations, coach stops, etc.) Some codes are used to create a free travel ticket of a particular type.[^1] For this reason, the `vnet` directory also contains `VNet Overrides.csv`, which contains only these non-stop codes.

### `vnet-stop-codes.json`
This file is generated by removing `VNet Overrides.csv` from `VNet Bookable Codes.csv`. 

`vnet-stop-codes.json` contains only the V/Net codes corresponding to physical locations.
